# SoS-Wheels

Remaking the Wheels table game from [Sea of Stars](https://seaofstarsgame.co/).  
I am using the language C because I want to, I know it's probably "sub-optimal" or whatever.

The game is currently not very user-friendly. I will eventually fix that but first I want to get the
actual game to work.

## TODO List

- [X] Change Hero stats depending on tier
- [X] Hero selection menu
- [X] Mage
- [ ] Hero Names & Description
- [ ] Improve user input, give feedback to user
- [ ] Help menu
- [ ] Adjust wheel chances
- [ ] Other wheels
